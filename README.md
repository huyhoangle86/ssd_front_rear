# Single Shot Detector on Vehicle Dataset

## Problem
* Given Deep learning problem for self-driving cars by training a Single Shot Detector (SSD) to recognize both the front and rear views of vehicles using a vehicle dataset curated and labeled by Davis King of dlib.
* Each image in this dataset was captured from a camera mounted to a carâ€™s dashboard. For each image, all visible front and rear views of vehicles are labeled as the image below.
* Given the dlib vehicel dataset (the dataset can be downloaded from here 
[link](http://dlib.net/files/data/)). The task is to use SSD to detect and localize front and rear of cars

## Built With
* Python
* Tensorflow Object Detection API (TFOD API)
* Google Colab

## Approach


Training process over 200,000 steps, which took approximately 13 hours on Google Colab. The loss ended at approximately 1.7
